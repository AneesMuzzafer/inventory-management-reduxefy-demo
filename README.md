# Inventory Management

This is an example app for demonstrating the usage of the `reduxefy-toolkit` and `react-reduxefy` packages. The app allows users to manage an inventory of products, categories & users.

You can view a live demo of the app at: [https://aneesmuzzafer.github.io/inventory-management-reduxefy-demo](https://aneesmuzzafer.github.io/inventory-management-reduxefy-demo)


## Check Out These Packages!

If you want to learn more about the packages that power this app, be sure to check out these repositories:

### `reduxefy`

`reduxefy` is a lightweight, bare-bones implementation of the original `redux` package. It is kind of like a hot drop-in replacement for `redux`. Check out why it exists here: [https://github.com/AneesMuzzafer/reduxefy](https://github.com/AneesMuzzafer/reduxefy)

### `reduxefy-toolkit`

Building on the power of `reduxefy`, `reduxefy-toolkit` provides a suite of utilities and helpers that make it even easier to work with Redux. With `reduxefy-toolkit`, you can quickly generate reducers, use immer.js to handle immutable state, and much more. Get started with `reduxefy-toolkit` here: [https://github.com/your-username/reduxefy-toolkit](https://github.com/your-username/reduxefy-toolkit)

### `react-reduxefy`

Finally, we have `react-reduxefy` - the glue that brings the reduxefy into your React components. With `react-reduxefy`, you can easily use `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks to access state and dispatch actions from within your components. Check it out here: [https://github.com/AneesMuzzafer/react-reduxefy](https://github.com/AneesMuzzafer/react-reduxefy)
